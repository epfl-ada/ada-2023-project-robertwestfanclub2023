# Investigation on patent personas of Film characters

## Abstract:

Our project explores how film genres change over time and follow seasonal trends in releases. We're curious about how different genres become popular in various places and throughout the year. For instance, it's rare to see Christmas movies being released in other parts of the year, and directors eager to win an award often release movies close to the Oscar's or Festival de Cannes period. By understanding these patterns, we want to predict future genre trends and see how release timing affects a movie's success at the box office. Alongside the main dataset, CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which has a lot of movie details, we plan to include information about awards. This extra data will help us see how release timing based on location affects winning awards. Using descriptive analysis, causal discovery, and exploratory analysis, our project aims to shed light on the fascinating dynamics of the film industry.

## Research Questions:

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- Question 1: How do film genres evolve over time, and what factors contribute to their popularity in various geographic regions and throughout the year?
- Question 2: Can historical patterns of genre popularity be used to predict future trends?
- Question 3: How does release timing impact a movie's success at the box office and its chances of winning awards?

## Dataset and proposed additional datasets:

**Main Dataset: CMU Movie Summary Corpus**

The main dataset is provided by the CMU Movie Summary Corpus project. It includes metadata for films and characters as well as plot summaries, all in the form of text: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/

**Proposed Additional Datasets:**

- Awards Dataset: To represent awards each movie received. (Source: To be determined)

## Methods

- Descriptive Analysis: Explore the historical evolution of genre popularity and seasonal trends.
- Causal Discovery: Identify factors influencing changes in genre popularity.
- Exploratory Analysis: Analyze the correlation between release timing, box office success, and potential awards.
