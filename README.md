# Investigation on patent personas of Film characters

## Abstract:

Our project explores how film genres change over time and follow seasonal trends in releases. We're curious about how different genres become popular in various places and throughout the year. For instance, it's rare to see Christmas movies being released in other parts of the year, and directors eager to win an award often release movies close to the Oscar's or Festival de Cannes period. By understanding these patterns, we want to predict future genre trends and see how release timing affects a movie's success at the box office. Alongside the main dataset, CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which has a lot of movie details, we plan to include information about awards. This extra data will help us see how release timing based on location affects winning awards. Using descriptive analysis, causal discovery, and exploratory analysis, our project aims to shed light on the fascinating dynamics of the film industry.

## Main Dataset: CMU Movie Summary Corpus

The main dataset is provided by the CMU Movie Summary Corpus project. It includes metadata for films and characters as well as plot summaries, all in the form of text: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/

## Research Questions:

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- Question 1: What is the relationship between a film's release timing in a year, its genre, and any recurring patterns? If such patterns exist, when have they been observed, and do they vary based on the film's place of release? Can these patterns be leveraged to predict the genre of the next season's film releases?
- Question 2: How does release timing impact a movie's success, particularly its likelihood of winning awards and receiving favorable ratings?
- Question 3: In what ways is a movie's popularity affected by its release period, considering factors such as box office revenue and ratings?

## Proposed additional datasets:

- Awards Dataset: (TODO: include description)
- IMDB Dataset: (TODO: include description)

## Methods

- Descriptive Analysis: Explore the historical evolution of genre popularity and seasonal trends.
- Causal Discovery: Identify factors influencing changes in genre popularity.
- Exploratory Analysis: Analyze the correlation between release timing, box office success, and potential awards.
